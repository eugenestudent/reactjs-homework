**React homework 1**

1. Create new repository for react homeworks with an appropriate name
2. Create React project using Vite (select **JS** option for now, **not** TS)
3. Remove unnecessary code
4. Create a basic structure of your project
5. Edit **package.json** file: add necessary information about you and your project
6. Create a **class** component which will render an **arbitrary list of items**, run application and add **screenshot** of you rendered list to merge request
7. Push code to your remote repository and open merge request:
   7.1 Merge request description should include:
    - homework number
    - what was done (description of your changes)
    - screenshot from option 6.

Please pay attention that for **each** homework you shell create **separate branch**.

You can merge your code only after getting an **approval** from a mentor and resolving all the **conflicts** if they exist.

Each pull request (PR) should contain only **one commit**. If there are several commits do not forget to make **squash**.

And good luck :)
